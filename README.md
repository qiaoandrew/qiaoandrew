# Welcome to My Profile! 👋

I'm a Grade 11 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau HS 🏫! My biggest passion has always been Computer Science 👨‍💻, and I'm always searching for new methods to expand my knowledge 📚 and to meet interesting people 😃! My goal is to create technologies 💻 to aid and inspire other individuals within my communities, while at the same time, making sure I have fun 😄!

I specialize in Java, and am also fairly skilled in Python! Here, I will be periodically posting various school and personal projects, including simulations and games. In the future, I am also planning to introduce some Flutter projects!

## My Current Focuses! 😄
- Expanding my knowledge on Flutter & Dart, utilizing them to enhance my [school's app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) 📱!
- Studying Unity to create some fun games 🎮!
- Finding new leadership opportunities to help inspire fellow students 🧑‍🎓!
- Trying my best at school and wherever I go 👍!
