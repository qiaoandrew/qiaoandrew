# Welcome to my Profile! 👋

Hi! My name is Andrew, and I'm a Grade 11 student at Pierre Elliott Trudeau HS 🏫! My biggest passion has always been Computer Science 👨‍💻, and I'm constantly searching for new methods to expand my knowledge and to meet interesting people! My goal is to create technologies to aid and inspire other individuals within my communities, while at the same time, making sure I, and the people around me, have fun 😄!

I specialize in Java, and am also fairly skilled in Python! Here, I will be periodically posting various school and personal projects, including simulations and games. In the future, I am also planning to introduce some Flutter projects!

## My Current Focuses! 😄
- Expanding my knowledge on Flutter & Dart, utilizing them to enhance my [school's app](https://www.trudeausac.com/app/) 📱!
- Studying Unity to create some fun games 🎮!
- Finding new leadership opportunities to inspire fellow students 🧑‍🎓!
- Doing my absolute best at school and wherever I go 👍!

## Fun Facts About Me! 🏆
- In the past, I have played many sports at a competitive level such as tennis 🎾, hockey 🏒, soccer ⚽️, and volleyball 🏐!
- Teaching is another one of my passions, and I work as a tennis coach over the summer ☀️!
- During my free time, I LOVE listening to music 🎧 and watching TV shows 📺!
- Currently, my favorite song 🎵 is "Life Goes On" by BTS, an inspiring song about overcoming and staying positive during tough situations!
